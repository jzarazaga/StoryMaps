### Data

The data package for the workshop can be downloaded from [https://github.com/zarazaga/storymap/master.zip](https://github.com/mapninja/QGIS-101/archive/master.zip)

The project data folder contains the following datasets:

* **deathAddresses.csv**  - this is a table latitude and longitude coordinates for addresses affected by the cholera outbreak. This table also contains the number of deaths at each address.  
* **image.tif** - this is a non-georeferenced image of the map from John Snow's original report on the cholera outbreak of 1854. 
* **Study_Area.shp** - This file is simply a rectangular feature that describes our area of interest.  

#### Additional Files
There is an extra backup data folder that contains versions of files that we will create during the workshop.
