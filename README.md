### Data

The data package for the workshop can be downloaded from [TTUdata](https://github.com/zarazaga/StoryMaps/tree/master/TTUdata.zip)

The data folder contains the following data:

* information.txt  - an optional text file for you to use to make this storymap
* college-view.jpg  - an image of the campus


#### Additional Help
The Storymap that will be built in this tutorial will be similar to this one: https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/a1d1dc5d48334c1f9aa9e412e23470ea
 
## Getting started
open a [new storymap](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/) and sign on, then '+' a story . . 

![newStory.png](./media/newStory.png)

First Write a title (*Taita Taveta University* ) and sub-title ( *home of ideas* )

and add the image 'college view' 

From the '+' select the element on the dropdown menu to include:

first add a Paragraph . . 

note: open the [text file](https://github.com/zarazaga/StoryMaps/TTU_data/information.txt) if you want to use the text I have prepared . .

![addBanner.png](./media/addBanner.png)

then add a quote:

Add a heading:  'Vision'
and an image: students_o
and some text explaining the university vision

And another heading: location
and add a 'map' ; 
start with an express map-

![expressMap.png](./media/expressMap.png)

and create a location map for the univeristy.

Add a few layers . .

Once you place the map, you can still edit it.
Under 'settings' (the small gear) you can change the basemap
and add a 'legend'

here is a link to my version - to follow along

Next, lets add a Sidecar . . 
![sidecar.png](./media/sidecar.png)

Add a sub-heading: Strategic Pillar
and add a series of images of the univeristy:.  

Eventually you'll want one for each pillar, but we can re-arrange them later. 

Pillar 1: Research,  Pillar 2: Facilities, Pillar 3: Student experience Pillar 4: Human Resources,  Pillar 5: Financing and Resources, Pillar 6: Leadership

![multipleImagesSidecar.png](./media/multipleImagesSidecar.png)

Put an image with each Pillar; for each image- add some text . .
Pillar 1: research, you can add a web-link and another link in Pillar 2.
There is a video to add to Pillar 3:
